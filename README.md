# Image Bankai
When enabled, will display a custom image on the client.

Place a file named profile.png in %userprofile%\\.runelite\ on Windows or ~/.runelite/ on Linux/OSX.

## Update image
Once the plugin finds an image, it saves it in memory. Simply changing profile.png wonâ€™t update what you see.

To reload the image, change any plugin setting, such as increasing and decreasing "Min Width" by 1.
